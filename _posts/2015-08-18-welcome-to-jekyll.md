In August, I left my position as a software engineer at Google and decided to embark on a new adventure as an ML engineer at Twitter Cortex.

I feel immensely grateful to have been a Googler for the past 3 years, and especially as my first job out of school. Along the way, I worked alongside many inspiring people and traveled to some new and interesting places. Here are some of the lessons I've distilled from my time at Google.

<!--more-->

* Be transparent, honest, and realistic. <!-- When tasked with a project that seems confusing or poorly motivated, speak up - don't isolate yourself assuming that you'll reason it out later! It can be difficult to speak up at the risk of appearing dumb. By clarifying misunderstandings and early on, you can prevent larger issues down the line. However, if this is happening too often, it may be a sign of a bigger issue. I'm still re-learning this all the time. -->
* Document everything while it's fresh in your mind. 
<!-- Do it for your own mental sake and for the sake of the project/company. It will make life easier by:-->
<!-- * promoting collaboration with others -->
<!-- * eliminating the burden of remembering details -->
<!-- * increasing the transparency of your project -->
* Work incrementally. <!-- Nothing of high quality is built in a day. -->
* Turn down work that doesn't align with your interests or goals. <!-- If your role allows it, be selective about the work you are doing if you are serious about learning and improving. -->
* Ask for and provide feedback. <!-- Everybody has blind spots, and nobody is perfect. The first step to learning is to become conscious of these blind spots. For solo projects, take time to self-evaluate often. -->
* Keep the big picture in mind, and don't sweat the details. <!-- It's easy to get invested trying to fix unimportant problems and problems bugs. At the end of the day, try to match your effort on a problem or task in proportion to its overall importance. -->
* Take regular breaks. <!-- We weren't wired to work for hours uninterrupted (or at least I'm not). Drink water, go on a walk, take a walk and focus on the shallowness and regularity of your breathing. -->
* Don't overthink or undervalue a simple hello.

I'm really excited to settle into a new & exciting environment and see what other lessons and experiences I pick up along the way!

<!-- Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
